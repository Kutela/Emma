      <h2> Introduction</h2>
      
      
      <p>A map presented below indicates the trajectories of trips that were made by connected vehicles (CVs) in Ann Arbor April 2013 as part of safety pilot model deployment (SPMD) project.
         The data for creating this visual analytic were acquired from <a herf = "https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Safety-Pilot-Model-Deployment-Data/a7qq-9vfe" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Transportation's public data portal.</a>
         In particular, the basic safety messages (BSMs) data file was explored in the analysis.
         Since the BSMs of each vehicle trip were collected every 0.1 sec, the data of all the trips made in April were too large for visualing them on a browser at once. I sampled the data of each trip to approximately 2 mins and created the map below.
